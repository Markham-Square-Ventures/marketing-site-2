Every business has a website these days â€“ it's easy to grab your site builder of choice, snap together a few pieces, press publish, and call it a day.

The problem is that simply having a website is **not** enough to drive results for your business. It takes a _tremendous_ amount of experimentation, design, writing, and thinking to build one that'll actually do what you want it to do.

That said, all of this effort is well worth it. A finely tuned website can quickly generate results that would knock the socks off your wildest growth forecasts.

Now, we've been saying results a lot, but what do we mean by that? Well, there are typically three things we care about with a business website:

1. Informing new people about what we offer so that they come back to us when they need us.
2. Actually selling to people who want what we offer.
3. Retaining & selling to repeat customers.

Folks have wasted a lot of ink & breath trying to over complicate this, but it really is this simple. By focusing on optimizing your website to achieve these three results, then you'll be blown away by the success you'll have.

Now that we know what to aim for, how does your website stack up? In the last month...

1. how many potential customers learned about what you sell via your website?
2. how many new sales can you directly attribute to your website?
3. how many repeat sales can you directly attribute to your website?

Given these metrics, what would your business look like if you 5x those numbers? 10x? 50x?! These exciting metrics are well within reach if you focus on optimizing your website to achieve these three results.

At this point, you're probably thinking, "that sounds amazing, I'm in. But, how do I _actually_ go about optimizing my website?"

Of course, you can get together your team together and figure it out. Or, if you're looking for a shortcut, you can [get in touch](https://calendly.com/nick-1330/markham-square-inquiry) with your friends at Markham Square and we'd love to help you out.

Whichever route you choose, just remember to keep your eye on the prize. Make sure your website is laser focused on informing new people about your offerings, selling them your offerings, and empowering repeat customers and you'll have a website that can actually drive results for your business.

Until next time, good luck!
