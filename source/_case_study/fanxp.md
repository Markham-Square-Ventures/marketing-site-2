FanXP was founded to help the music industry adapt to the coming age of reciprocity on the web. They believe in helping musicians collaborate with their fans to build their careers, and ensuring that fans are continually rewarded for their support.

Markham Square helped FanXP design and deploy their initial brand, website, and product to deliver an experience that resonates with fans and artists alike.
