SolDev is the best place on the web to stay up-to-date with the latest updates, learning, and happenings in the Solana ecosystem.

Their experience had grown organically over time, and they were ready to reorganize all of their content to be easier for readers to consume.

We collaborated with them to understand their content goals and designed a new information architecture (IA) to suit their needs. We then redesigned their site experience to reflect the updated IA and to better communicate their personality as well.
