Lynden Lane is sought after for architecting transformative events and designing interior spaces.

They reached out to us with a website project that was already well underway. Unfortunately, it was over budget, behind schedule, and the design did not meet their expectations.

We worked closely with them to determine their immediate priorities, redesign the experience from scratch, and deliver a website & custom CMS ahead of schedule and on budget.
